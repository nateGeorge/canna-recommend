Scraping coding is becoming huge, and having some problems in the threads.  For example:
sometimes 0 results are returned (i.e. the page doesn't load).  Sometimes after a few tries it reloads.  Ideas for error handling?
Same thing with the first page that checks number of reviews.  

Removing dupes in mongo sucks.
