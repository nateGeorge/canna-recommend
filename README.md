# canna-recommend
Recommend cannabis strains and products to users, because there are thousands of strains and not enough time to learn about them all.

# Directions for running
Make sure to run all scripts from the main directory of the project (canna-recommend).  E.g. python2 apps/web_app/app.py
This is due to relative imports in the script, which I standardized by expecting the script to be run from the home dir.
