# Data Science
redo gridsearch -- found 10 groups to be best
better suggestions (more variety, match exact strains, etc) -- still haven't finished
 - match top 3 groups first by scoring function (with some randomness)
 - match top 50 strains by another scoring function (with some randomness)

cluster viz for suggestions -- plotly (maybe bokeh later) 3d scatter with labels -- havent finished
that link to strain page on click -- done
scrape analytical 360 -- not yet
 - prototype NN % strength regressor

prototype pyfm -- nope

cluster stuff by tfidf

# Website work:
bag-of-words on site that holds your words you've chosen
clicking strain name takes you to leafly page
