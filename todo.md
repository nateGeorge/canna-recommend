# Data Science
redo gridsearch -- found 10 groups to be best
better suggestions (more variety, match exact strains, etc) -- still haven't finished
 - match top 3 groups first by scoring function (with some randomness)
 - match top 50 strains by another scoring function (with some randomness)

cluster viz for suggestions -- plotly (maybe bokeh later) 3d scatter with labels -- havent finished

 - prototype neural net % strength regressor

prototype pyfm -- nope

cluster stuff by tfidf - 2 clusters gives best silhouette_score

# Website work:
bag-of-words on site that holds your words you've chosen -- need to scale words for mobile
--looks cheesy (use framework)
